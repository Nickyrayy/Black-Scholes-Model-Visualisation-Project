# ðŸ“ˆ Black-Scholes Model Visualisation Project

This project is a option pricing model visualisation tool implemented in Python.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the **Black-Scholes-Merton** option pricing model under changing variables.

### Features
* **Call & Put** graphs on OG BSM model and Lelan's variation.
* Easy **height and rotation** sliders for all graphs independent of eachother.
* Interactable and changeable graph **plotting parametres**.
* Interactable **Implied Volatility** and **Greeks** output based on model and option type.
* Tool to compare **price differences** between the two models.
* Efficient **data caching** to reduce computation times when style variables are changed e.g rotation.
* Project info + about me.
* Info on how the models work and some history behinfd them.

## Tools Used

* [Python:](https://www.python.org/) (The core programming language for the project)
* [Streamlit:](https://streamlit.io/) (Used for building the interactive and user-friendly web interface)
* [Matplotlib:](https://matplotlib.org/) (Used for plotting the option pricing graphs and visualizing the effects of different parameters)
* [NumPy:](https://numpy.org/) (Used for efficient numerical computation of the models)
* [SciPy:](https://scipy.org/) (Used for advanced mathematical functions)

## How to Run the app locally

To run the app locally, make sure you have **Python** and some kind of package manager like **miniconda** installed and follow these steps in your terminal:

1.  **Clone the Repo (Make a copy):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Nickyrayy/Black-Scholes-Model-Visualisation-Project.git
    ```

2.  **Move into the project**
    ```bash
    cd Black-Scholes-Model-Visualisation-Project
    ```

3.  **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run the webpage locally!:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run streamlit_app.py
    ```
