    st.markdown("""
    The **Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model** is a foundational framework in financial engineering. Developed by Fischer Black, Myron Scholes, and Robert Merton, it provides a differential equation that can be solved to give a theoretical price for European-style options. The model's elegance lies in its closed-form solution, which requires a set of simplifying assumptions about the market.

        - **Option Style:** Applicable only to **European options**, which can be exercised solely at expiration.
        - **Dividends:** The underlying asset pays no dividends during the option's life. (The model can be adjusted to account for them).
        - **Market Dynamics:** Market movements are unpredictable and follow a Geometric Brownian Motion with constant drift and volatility. This is often termed the "Random Walk" theory.
        - **Frictionless Market:** No transaction costs or taxes are involved in buying or selling assets. (This is handled by Hayne E. Leland's variation on the volatility calculation to incorporate transaction costs.)
        - **Constant Parameters:** The risk-free interest rate and the volatility of the underlying asset are known and remain constant throughout the option's life.
        - **Distribution of Returns:** Returns on the underlying asset are lognormally distributed.

    A primary critique of the BSM model is its "frictionless market" assumption. In reality, dynamically hedging an option portfolio incurs transaction costs. **Hayne Leland's 1985 model** extends the BSM framework by incorporating these costs, offering a more realistic valuation.
    
    The model's core idea is to adjust the volatility term in the BSM formula to account for the additional variance created by hedging in the presence of costs.

    This adjusted volatility, $\sigma_{adj}$, is then substituted back into the standard BSM formulas to derive the option price. Since the option's Gamma ($\Gamma$) is positive for standard long call/put positions, this adjustment effectively increases the asset's volatility, leading to higher option premiums.
