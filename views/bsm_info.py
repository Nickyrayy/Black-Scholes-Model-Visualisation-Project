Developed by Fischer Black, Myron Scholes, and Robert Merton, it provides a differential equation that can be solved to give a theoretical price for European-style options. The model's elegance lies in its closed-form solution, which requires a set of simplifying assumptions about the market.

            One of the most significant limitations of the Black-Scholes model is its assumption of a frictionless market. In practice, the continuous portfolio rebalancing required for a perfect delta hedge would lead to infinite transaction costs.

            Hayne Leland's 1985 model addresses this by providing a practical solution. Instead of fundamentally altering the BSM equation, Leland showed that the effect of transaction costs could be approximated by adjusting a single, critical input: **volatility**. The logic is that transaction costs add to the risk of hedging, and this increased risk is analogous to an increase in the asset's volatility. By 'inflating' the volatility, the model charges a higher premium for the option to cover anticipated transaction costs.
